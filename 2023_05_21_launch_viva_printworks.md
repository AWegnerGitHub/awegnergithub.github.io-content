[Viva Printworks][vivaetsylink] has launched! It's a small - for now - business producing unique designs
for various products. We are launching with 30 designs on t-shirt and hope to expand to other product types in 
the coming months.

[Dana][danalinkedin] and I have talked about building a side business off and on for years. During my [job search][1]
last year (and [all][2] the [fun][3] that [entailed][4]), these discussions became most ernest. After determining what 
we wanted to do, figuring out the technicalities of starting a business, and figuring out how we were going to accomplish
this - we did it!

[Viva Printworks][vivaetsylink] launched our first wave of designs on May 18, 2023 on Etsy. As we go through 
launch, growth, expansion and general business lifecycles, we hope to expand beyond a single platform. 

This is exciting for us! Check us out at [Viva Printworks on Etsy][vivaetsylink]. I suspect that I'll have posts
in the future here, as well, discussing some of the technical aspects of the business.
