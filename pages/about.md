Title: About Andrew Wegner
Slug: about
Status: published

I lead engineering teams to win - both in business outcomes and in conquering complex technical challenges.

I've scaled teams as VP of Strategic Software at Zayo and VP of Software Engineering at PacketFabric. I've 
served as Fractional CTO at White Square Media and Director of Engineering at FleetOps/Class8 and Woven Teams. 
Earlier in my career, I was an Application Lead at Caterpillar and managed the residential helpdesk at 
Northern Illinois University. I've built products used worldwide and mentored engineers across the globe.

My experience spans computer science and information security across academia, manufacturing, transportation, 
logistics, telecommunications, and HR tech. I've worked everywhere from pre-seed startups to 
Fortune 500 corporations - giving me a unique perspective on building high-quality engineering teams at any scale.

Since 2017, I've served as an elected moderator on Stack Overflow, helping maintain one of the world's 
largest developer communities.

When I'm not leading teams or writing code, you'll find me playing board games, diving into video games, 
or tackling hands-on projects. (Preferably in warm weather - winters are cold enough already.)
