## Ethics Statement

This site is a fairly small corner of the internet. It's designed to be a place where I can share my thoughts and musing on technical
items, personal projects, and interesting problems I've encountered (probably more than once and had to go search for an answer again). 
I also like to share my opinion on various products I've used, if they are part of a larger project, or courses I've taken so that others
can see if someone has found them useful.

Sponsored content is rare on the site. However, I do have affiliate links to a couple places like Amazon and Udemy. In any place that I'm utilizing an affiliate link, it's because I've personally utilized the product or service.

There are a few points that I want to post so that everyone is on the same page:

 * My words and my work are my own. Content that is sponsored is produced by me, edited by me, and released by me with no previews provided or approvals received. There are no exceptions to this.
 * My reviews are objective and based on my own experiences and research of the product or service.
 * Sponsored content will be listed below this statement for full transparency. Additionally, a banner will be posted on each article with sponsored content or affiliate links with a link back to this statement.
 * I can not guarentee any number of views, clicks, or interactions on sponsored content. I am not a professional content creator, nor do I have the expertise to make content go viral.

Finally, in the spirit of full transparency, the following content has either been sponsored or contains affiliate links.

Thank you for taking a moment to read and understand my Ethics Statement. Additionally, thanks to [Tom Buck][tom], whose Ethics Statement was the inspiration and template I based my own upon.
